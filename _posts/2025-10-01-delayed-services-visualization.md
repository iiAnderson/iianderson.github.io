# Service Delay Distribution: An Interactive Analysis

Over the period from September 11-25, 2025, we captured detailed delay data across the UK rail network. This visualization shows how services are distributed across four delay buckets: 0-5 minutes, 5-15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, and 30+ minutes delayed.

## Interactive Visualization

Use the dropdown below to filter by Train Operating Company (TOC) or view aggregated data across all operators.

## Key Findings

The stacked chart suggests:
- Rail performance is generally consistent, although there are notable drops on Sunday's - likely owing to the fact most rail staff are not contracted to work on Sundays.
- Certain train operators (Avanti, Cross Country) have notably poorer performance than other operators.
- Most trains run on time!
